  title: "Job Service"
  version: "1.0"
  description: |
    Allows background operations to be sent to the workers, and for the
    operations to be tracked and controlled.

    You can check the progress of operations, and request to cancel, pause, or resume them.  *NB: Pause and Resume are future
    requirements.*

    The primary use of this functionality is batch document
    processing.  The service can send work to the Batch Worker, and
    then track the progress of that work.
