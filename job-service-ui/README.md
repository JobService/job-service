# Job Service UI

This Swagger UI project builds a documentation web application for the [Job Service](../job-service). It allows
users to see what operations the web service exposes as well as documentation relating to those operations and the web service in general.

## Usage

To get started, deploy the [Job Service Postgres Container](../job-service-postgres-container) and deploy the [Job Service Docker Container](../job-service-container).
The web service UI can then be accessed at the following URL:

	http://<docker.ip.address>:<port>/job-service-ui

Replace `<docker.ip.address>` and `<port>` as necessary.
