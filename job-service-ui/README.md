# Job Service UI

This Swagger UI project builds a documentation web application for the [Job Service](https://github.hpe.com/caf/job-service). It allows
users to see what operations the web service exposes as well as documentation relating to those operations and the web service in general.

## Usage

To get started, install the [job service database](https://github.hpe.com/caf/job-service/tree/develop/job-service-db) and deploy the [web service docker container](https://github.hpe.com/caf/job-service/tree/develop/job-service-container).
The web service UI can then be accessed at the following URL:

	http://<docker.ip.address>:<port>/job-service-ui

Replace `<docker.ip.address>` and `<port>` as necessary.
