# caf-restapi-client-base
This project provides a base (i.e. parent) pom for swagger-generated REST API clients.
It centralizes properties and dependency management required by client projects that use the swagger-codegen-maven-plugin.
For an example of a swagger-generated REST API client project that is based on caf-restapi-client-base see [job-service-client](https://github.hpe.com/caf/job-service-client).
